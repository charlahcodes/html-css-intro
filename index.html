    <a href="#">Gaius Julius Caesar (100 BC - 44 BC)</a> was a Roman statesman, general and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. In 60 BC, Caesar, Crassus, and Pompey formed a political alliance that was to dominate Roman politics for several years. Their attempts to amass power through populist tactics were opposed by the conservative ruling class within the Roman Senate, among them Cato the Younger with the frequent support of Cicero. Caesar's victories in the Gallic Wars, completed by 51 BC, extended Rome's territory to the English Channel and the Rhine. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both when he built a bridge across the Rhine and conducted the first invasion of Britain.</p>

    <a href="#">Augustus Caesar (63 BC - AD 14)</a> was the founder of the Roman Empire and its first Emperor, ruling from 27 BC until his death in 14 AD.  He was born Gaius Octavius into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian Octavii family. Following the assassination of his maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar in 44 BC, Octavian was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir. Together with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus, he formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at Philippi, the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators.  The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart under the competing ambitions of its members: Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Octavian in 31 BC.</p>

    <a href="#">Little Caesar (AD 1959 - Present)</a> is a diminutive toga-clad Roman wearing sandals and a laurel wreath who serves as the corporate mascot for the Little Caesars pizza franchise - one of the world's largest pizza chains. The slogan for the company is "Pizza! Pizza!" which the Little Caesar character recites quickly. The slogan originated when the company advertised their "buy one, get one free" concept namely "Two great pizzas! One low price. Always! Always!"  Compared to previous Caesars, Little Caesar controls a miniscule empire.</p>

   A <a href="#">Caesar Salad (AD 1924 - Present)</a> is a salad of romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with parmesan cheese, lemon juice, olive oil, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and black pepper.  The salad's creation is generally attributed to restaurateur Caesar Cardini, an Italian immigrant who operated restaurants in Mexico and the United States.  The extent of Caesar Salad's empire is unknown.</p>
